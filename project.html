            <p>The aim of the event was to introduce the top influencers to the brand Hennessy and also for our client to have a chance to educate the influencers more on how to pair up the cognac with food</p>
            <p>Mr. Dominguez used the stages of a 4-course fine dining meal to let the personalities sip and savor the different pearls on the Hennessy crown.They were able learn and taste the great cognacs of Maison Hennessy; the very special (V.S), Very Superior Old Pale (VSOP) and of course the ultimate Extra Old (X.O) accompanied by stories of how each name came to be.</p>
